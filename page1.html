    <h1>The Nogan Manifesto</h1>
    <p>Hi there. My name is Bushy Peter. Some years ago me and my many wives had somewhat of an epiphany. 
        While crossing the country in one of our many deisel 1960s camper vans and jet setting around the world 
        we all came to the same conclusion. 
        <br>
        DO NOT EAT ANYTHING.
        <br>
        At first this may seem like an unusual statement (a point initially raised by wifelet number 6). 
        But hear ye hear ye. The human animal must only master the fine art of Photosynthesis to transcend 
        the needs of the mouth and stomach.
    </p>
    <p>Rule One - DO NOT EAT.
        <br>
        This is not an art than can be mastered simply overnight and requires an expremley high level of dedication
        (about 3 or 4 nights should do it)
        One must sit all day in the lotus position, the tree position or the 7th dimensional Zardoz position 
        while in direct sunlight wearing nothing but a full set of clothes.
        If this technique is proving difficult then you are allowed one potatoe a day. Following the consumtion
        of the potatoe you must whip yourself on the bottom with a tree branch 7 times as penance
        (ensure the branch is still connected to the tree otherwise dedudct 20 virtue points)
    </p>
    <p>Rule Two - You DO NOT talk about Nogan Photosynthesis club
        <br>
        It is absolutly fine to talk about Nogan Photosythesis club. Spreading the good word of almighty Sols invisible 
        nourishment waves is encouraged, expected, and violently enforced.
    </p>
    <p>Rule 3 - Drinking is allowed (somtimes)
        <br>
        One may drink a little water whence not under the watchful eye of the infallible flaming ball in the sky.
        <br>
        Nightime is ok to drink, in shade is ok, 
        in cloud cover is permitted along as the cloud is at no less than 20% opacity.
    </p>
    <p>Rule 4 - Sacerdos amplissimus dei invicti Soli Elagabali, pontifex maximus
        <br>
        You have 20 seconds to comply
    </p>
    <p>Rule 5 - Mind the gap
        <br>
        Whence whereth whence using the London underground rail service (known colloquially as 'The Tube') one must always 
        make sure to mind the gap.
    </p>
